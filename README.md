Exam rules
You are working with teams. Team Leader: Created the repository. There is ONE document for the team report. Please organize the structure, and finally, each student should update the report. After the exam, you will exchange your reports and evaluate the reports of other teams (with individual scores for each student â€“ the author must be listed in the report). Everyone in the team should provide an individual score, and I will calculate the average. You can vote anonymously within the team ðŸ™‚. Please organize this process.

You can use any help you want, but using your colleague's work is forbidden.
