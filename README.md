## 2. Work Summary
A brief description of overall project progress, key achievements, and any encountered issues.
Exam rules
You are working with teams. Team Leader: Created the repository. There is ONE document for the team report. Please organize the structure, and finally, each student should update the report. After the exam, you will exchange your reports and evaluate the reports of other teams (with individual scores for each student â€“ the author must be listed in the report). Everyone in the team should provide an individual score, and I will calculate the average. You can vote anonymously within the team ðŸ™‚. Please organize this process.

You can use any help you want, but using your colleague's work is forbidden.

The data is in Teams in the corresponding folder.

NOTICE: The tasks are ordered by difficulty: Task 1 is the easiest, and Task 3 is the most difficult.

Task 1 Analysis of the correlation between temperature and NDVI
read temp 1 ndvi1
display 2 images with defiened palete
create 2 histograms
create scatter plot x=ndvi y=temp
repeat point 1-4 for temp2 and ndvi2

Perform analysis in Python and Matlab/Octave (both)

If you want to see the GEE code: https://code.earthengine.google.com/150e730dc6ea42320cc4091a9d6c1de0

Task 2 DEM analysis
read DEM
read point cloud
calculate differences: deltaH=point cloud H - DEM
calculate accuracy metrics
If you are able do all in Python, if not perform pre-processing in QGIS/ArcGIS/SAGA.. only accuracy anaysis make in Python OR Matlab/Octave

calculate difference between DEM 2024 - DEM 2021
check Groud Motion Service
Task 3 Classification accuracy
perform Sentinel-2 classification - K-Means any tool
download LULC map (i.e. Urban Atlas or Corine)
perform accuracy analysis using https://github.com/RemoteSys/accuracy
